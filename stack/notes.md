Stacks are perfect for problems where you need **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)** 
behavior — meaning the most recent thing must be handled first.

> If a problem has **nested, reversible, or paired structure** → stack 
is likely the best tool

### 1) Matching pairs / balanced structures

You need to match opening → closing in order.

✅ Perfect for:
+ Valid parentheses "(()())"
+ HTML/XML tag validation
+ Matching brackets {[()]} 

### 2) Undo / revert / backtracking behavior

Whenever you need to undo the last action, like a browser history.

✅ Examples:
+ Undo typing
+ Browser forward/back buttons (navigation)
+ Reversing operations

### 3) Evaluate expressions (math, logic, RPN)

Expressions that require resolving operations in correct order.

✅ Examples:
+ Evaluate "3 + (4 * 2)"
+ Convert infix → postfix
+ Reverse Polish Notation calculator
