* Applicable problem:
1) Sorted array & need to find a pair/target
Typical pattern: one pointer at start, one at end.

Examples:
+ Find two numbers that sum to X
+ Count pairs less than X
+ Check if array has a pair with difference X

2) Removing / skipping / filtering elements in-place
One fast pointer scans, one slow pointer builds result.

Examples:
+ Remove duplicates in sorted array
+ Remove specific value
+ Move zeros to end
3) Reverse or compare from both ends
Examples:
+ Check if a string is a palindrome
+ Compare start/end values for symmetry
+ Reverse array/string in place

4) Sliding / shrinking window problems
A “window” grows and shrinks using two pointers.

Examples:
+ Find longest substring without repeating chars
+ Minimum window to satisfy condition
+ Max consecutive elements with condition
